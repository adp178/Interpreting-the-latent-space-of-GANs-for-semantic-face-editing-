# Interpreting-the-latent-space-of-GANs-for-semantic-face-editing-
This project aims to build a controllable Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) that facilitates the control of facial attributes through manipulation of latent space. We have used pre-trained StyleGAN2-ADA to generate photorealistic faces and SVM hyperplanes to interpret itâ€™s latent space. This allowed us to understand the encoding of facial semantics and their disentanglement in the latent space learnt by GAN.
